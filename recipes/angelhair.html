<img src="../img/angelhair.jpg">
<h2>Description</h2>
This family-favorite angel chicken recipe is full of flavor and easy to make with condensed soup and cream cheese. It's special enough to serve when you're entertaining guests. I usually double the recipe so we can have leftovers.
<h2>Ingredients</h2>
<ul>
    <li>6 skinless, boneless chicken breast halves</li>
    <li>¼ cup butter</li>
    <li>1 (.7 ounce) package dry Italian-style salad dressing mix</li>
    <li>1 (10.5 ounce) can condensed golden mushroom soup</li>
    <li>½ cup white wine</li>
    <li>4 ounces cream cheese with chives</li>
    <li>1 (16 ounce) package angel hair pasta</li>
</ul>
<h2>Directions</h2>
<ol>
    <h3>Step 1</h3>
    <li>Preheat the oven to 325 degrees F (165 degrees C). Arrange chicken breasts in a single layer in a 9x13-inch baking dish.</li>
    <h3>Step 2</h3>
    <li>Melt butter in a large saucepan over low heat. Stir in dressing mix, then stir in condensed soup and wine. Add cream cheese; cook and stir, without boiling, until smooth and heated through. Pour over chicken.
    </li>
    <h3>Step 3</h3>
    <li>Bake in the preheated oven until chicken is no longer pink in the center and the juices run clear, about 1 hour. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the center should read at least 165 degrees F (74 degrees C).</li>
    <h3>Step 4</h3>
    <li>About 15 minutes before the chicken is finished, bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a rolling boil. Add angel hair pasta and cook, stirring occasionally, until tender yet firm to the bite, 4 to 5 minutes. Drain.</li>
    <h3>Step 5</h3>
    <li>Serve chicken and sauce over pasta.
    </li>
